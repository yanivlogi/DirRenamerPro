# DirRenamer

DirRenamer is a Python script designed to simplify the process of batch renaming directories.

## Features

- Rename multiple directories in bulk.
- Specify the root directory, prefix, and starting number for renaming.
- Automatically handle edge cases such as duplicate directory names or missing directories.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Run the script with Python by providing the necessary arguments:

```bash
python dir_renamer.py <root_directory> <prefix> <start_number>
```

Replace `<root_directory>`, `<prefix>`, and `<start_number>` with your desired values.

## Example

```bash
python dir_renamer.py /path/to/root/directory 'E' '1'
```

This will rename all directories in `/path/to/root/directory` starting from `1` and prefixing them with `E`.
